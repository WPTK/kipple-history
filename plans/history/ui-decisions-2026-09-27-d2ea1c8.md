# UI design meeting: decision log

Round 1, 2026-09-25 (the owner and Claude). Inputs: `docs/research/ui-principles-and-accessibility.md`,
`ui-color-schemes.md` (+ `.json`), `ui-gestures-and-layouts.md`, `design-audit-2026-09-25.md`.
This file records what the owner decided. It is the authority where the research files differ. Round-1 TODOs
were resolved in round 2 and what shipped; each is annotated below.

## Accessibility

- WCAG deviations are fine as defaults **provided an option exists to enable the accessible behavior**,
  and enabling any option must never break anything else.
- Implement everything the research file lists for **phase 2 and phase 3**, including read-aloud,
  `prefers-contrast`, reduced motion, text scaling, focus and semantics, live region for new items.
- More **density** options than the three presets (TODO, resolved: Dense, Snug, Standard, Relaxed and Airy steps, see
  Round 2).
- Font: add **Atkinson Hyperlegible Next** as a font option, labelled "Easy to read". OpenDyslexic is
  dropped (weak evidence). Font file size is not a concern.
- The proposed six-control Accessibility settings section is approved. Look for further opportunities in it.

## Colors

- the owner loves the eight schemes and their names: **Paper, Linen, Parchment, Fern→(renamed), Cocoa, Graphite,
  Midnight, Signal**. Alternate names are not wanted.
- **Fern is renamed.** Theme: the green pages of a phone book (municipal and government listings) or other
  paper. Candidates: Ledger, Directory, Gazette, Bond. (Resolved in round 2: Directory.) The green itself should be "a
  little softer" than the proposal, but only a little.
- **Cocoa** is too dark as a background: rework (lighter warm brown).
- Keep **both Paper and Linen**. Add a **gray** theme with a paper-themed name (candidate: Newsprint).
- Add more schemes: some accessibility-friendly (color-blind-safe accents, cream/low-glare, high-contrast
  dark), some purely pretty and legible. Paper-themed names preferred. (Resolved: 20 schemes shipped, see Round 2 and `web/src/theme/schemes.json`.)
- **Follow system** stays. Default pair when no custom pair is chosen: Paper (day) / Midnight (night)
  (the owner wrote "paper/onyx"; Onyx was Midnight's alternate name, so Midnight is assumed. Confirm). An
  option lets the owner pick any custom day theme and night theme for follow-system.
- Midnight text `#e0e0e0` is bright enough. **No image dimming** in dark themes.
- No Kipple identity/accent color now. Parking lot: a design system, a static demo site, and pull-and-run
  image for others (Kipple stays single-user).

## Gestures and navigation

- Must be iOS compliant in the least annoying way (nothing starting in the left ~24 px; no fighting Safari's
  back gesture; every gesture has a button).
- Haptics not needed; visual snap plus **undo toast** is approved.
- **Row swipe: full swipe with undo. Swipe left = mark read, swipe right = mark unread.** (Star: TODO, resolved: a row button, a swipe, `s` and the row menu.)
- **Article swipe: swipe back to the previous screen** (the article list you came from, not always the feed
  list), i.e. drill-in navigation stack. Keep next/previous **buttons** and **j/k**.
- Keys: j/k next/previous, s star, o open original, r refresh, m mark read (plus common conventions, TODO
  keymap; resolved, the KEYMAP in `web/src/lib/keys.ts`).
- First-run **peek animation** teaches swipe reveal.
- Mark-read-on-scroll: keep as a setting, **off by default**.

## Layout

- **Magazine is the default**; compact list and cards also ship. the owner likes the proposed layouts and wants
  other options explored, notably an **email-style ("Inbox") layout** (TODO research, resolved: Inbox shipped; the five layouts are
  Editorial (id `magazine`, this decision's "Magazine"), Cards, Compact, Inbox and Email - Compact (id
  `headlines`)).
- Lead images: **proxied and cached** by Kipple (sites dislike hotlinking), with a **bounded cache** that
  cannot grow out of hand (size cap setting with LRU eviction on the data volume). This replaces the
  design's "no disk cache in phase 2".

## design.md audit answers

1. Appearance settings are **per device**.
2. Default sort **newest first** (oldest-first available).
3. Mark above/below: best practice, defined against the list's own order (TODO API, resolved: the `bound` scope of mark-read).
4. Keymap from the answers above plus common conventions.
5. Image privacy and embeds: open but safe (`Referrer-Policy`, CSP, sandboxed embeds, TODO, resolved: referrer meta tag and click-to-load embeds).
6. **Export backup** in the UI (saves a file wherever the owner wants); for testing, an off-box copy is fine.
7. Rollback cost accepted (restore the pre-migration snapshot).
8. **Keyword mute filters: yes**, and other filtering features in the same family (TODO brainstorm, resolved in round 2).
9. Pending defaults and search: follow industry best practice (FTS5 stemming with prefix fallback).
10. Offline/PWA scope: read and interact with what is already downloaded; show an "offline" message at
    launch; queue actions and sync when back online. (Shipped in phase 3, design §7.9: manifest,
    service worker, an offline notice, and a queue for star and read changes. Prefetch keeps only the first page of Unread.)

## Parking lot additions

Design system / static demo site / pull-and-run image; Cloudflare Access JWT; passwordless login; scheduled
auto-night. See memory `parking-lot`.

## Next chunks

All four steps are done (historical list).

1. Round-2 research (colors, layouts incl. Inbox, keymap, gesture spec, filters brainstorm, accessibility spec).
2. Consolidate into a UI spec and update `design.md` (audit contradictions).
3. Backend items these decisions add (image cache, mute filters, mark above/below, oldest-first order,
   per-device settings, backup export, security headers, FTS stemming, health status reconciliation).
4. Frontend build after the owner signs off the UI spec.

## Round 2 answers (2026-09-25, later)

Authoritative over the round-1 and round-2 research files where they differ. the owner: "Go ahead and begin
implementing anything. Commit and PR as needed without asking." (Host-A deploys still need his go-ahead.)

### Colors
- Green theme is **Directory** (Fern retired). Gray is **Newsprint**. Keep **both Cocoas** (Kraft and Mid).
- Keep **Teletype and Lamplight**. Fix **Signal's danger** color (deuteranopia). **Carbon and Fountain must be
  visually further apart** (Carbon: neutral cool gray-black; Fountain: clearly navy with cream text).
- Follow-system: default Paper (day) and Midnight (night). The custom day and night pickers are **not**
  restricted by kind: any scheme may be either.
- Theme picker: default short list, the rest collapsed under "More themes" (Hick's law); accessibility group
  collapsed. (This is the Settings picker; the Aa menu has a compact grouped select of every theme.)
- New themes added in round 2 stay: Foolscap, Tracing, Carbon, Lamplight, Inkwell, Teletype, Airmail,
  Stationery, Tissue, Fountain.

### Layouts
- Ship **all five**: Magazine (default), Cards, Compact, Inbox, Headlines (shipped; Magazine is labelled
  Editorial and Headlines Email - Compact, ids unchanged). Parked: Columns, Reader list,
  Expanded stream.
- Layout is choosable **per feed and per folder** (override), plus a global/device default. UI in phase 2.
- Density: the owner doubts sliders. Use **named steps in a segmented picker with a live preview**
  (Dense / Snug / Standard / Relaxed / Airy). One "Density" choice drives both list rows and reading text;
  an "Adjust separately" disclosure splits them. No sliders, no "link" toggle. Must not look messy.

### Gestures and keys
- **Swipe directions match iOS Mail everywhere** (this supersedes round 1's "read left, unread right"):
  swipe right (leading) = toggle read/unread; swipe left (trailing) = star, plus a "More" action opening the
  row menu. Full swipe commits with undo. Star also has a row button, `s`, and the long-press menu.
- Undo toast lasts **15 seconds** (merged toast; `z` undo stack as specified).
- Single-key shortcuts: global on/off setting. `c`: toggle the Compact layout (match the layout system).
  `m` in Unread view: row dims in place (shipped differently: a row marked read on purpose dims,
  then leaves the Unread list after 1.5 s with the undo toast up; the open article leaves when you
  move off it; a swiped row leaves at once; undo or mark unread cancels it). `Shift+A` marks only items present when the list loaded. Mark
  above/below approved (anchor excluded, disabled for relevance-sorted search).

### Backend features
- Filters family **F1 to F7 in phase 2** (mute, mark read, auto-star, only-show-matching, highlights, saved
  searches, auto-read after N days, reading-time filter, per-feed view/order). (Shipped in phase 2: mute,
  mark read, star, highlight, saved searches and auto-read. Not shipped: only-show-matching, a
  reading-time filter UI (the API has `min_minutes` and `max_minutes`), and per-feed view/order (order
  is per device).) Quiet hours rejected.
- Image cache default cap **1 GiB** (check Host-A free disk before deploy). Default mode: **all images**
  (inline too) through Kipple, matching common RSS-reader practice; enables the strict CSP.
- Backup export, `kipple restore`, `kipple password`; ship them (and take an off-box export) before the
  0004/0005 migrations reach the live DB. Implementation order: `backend-additions-round2.md` §11.

### Working agreement
- Commit and open PRs without asking. Merge docs-only PRs when CI is green. Code PR for `phase-2` opens at
  deploy time. Reviews (Opus, high) after every two or three backend steps; fix all findings.

## Stats round (phase 4 pre-meeting, 2026-09-26)

Decisions are recorded in full in the private history repository. Summary of what shapes the build:

- **Focus:** sources and pruning (most read, time per source, never opened) with habits at the top (summary strip,
  daily activity, streaks, weekday-by-hour heatmap, behavior facts). Wrapped is a simple yearly summary with an opt-in
  share sheet, aggregates only by default. No goals, targets, badges, comparisons with other people or directives.
- **Reading:** every open is recorded; views count an item as read at 10 s active time or 25% scroll. List-preview
  opens count. Reading stats (open, read time, scroll, open original, share) are web-only; Reader API clients are not tracked for reading (`stats.api_single_read_is_open` stays off), though their stars are recorded.
- **Screen:** one Stats nav entry, phone first. Range Week/Month/Year/All (default Month). Items/Minutes toggle with
  folder rollup; average read length, quick-bounce rate, open-original rate, most-starred feeds; never opened.
  Deferred: per-feed drill-down, period comparison, monthly charts, read rate per feed.
- **Settings:** first day of week (Sunday or Monday, default Sunday); stats on/off (off stops recording and hides the
  screen, keeps data); Wrapped on/off; delete a range; delete all (typed confirmation).
- **Export:** raw events as CSV, JSON or JSON Lines; the summary is JSON only (a summary is several tables, so a CSV or JSON Lines summary was not built). Range, a toggle to leave out article titles and links (feed and folder names, times and the time zone stay), and a data dictionary. Export and delete stay available with statistics off.
- **Sender:** 15 s flush, visibilitychange primary and pagehide backup, 2 minute idle cutoff, a random id on every event
  (unique index) for dedup, offline events queued, losses accepted.
- **Delivery:** alpha.4 sender and settings, alpha.5 screen, alpha.6 export and data controls, alpha.7 Wrapped.

## Phase 5 planning meeting (2026-09-27)

Not a UI meeting - recorded here per the owner's instruction that all planning decisions land in this file plus
`kipple-history`. Phases 1-4 are complete (v0.3.0-alpha.7 deployed, kipple.cc public). Six topics, one at a time
with a recommendation each, same format as the phase 4 pre-meeting.

1. **What phase 5 is.** Not release-steps-only, not parking-lot-only: the owner chose to **interleave** release
   readiness (steps 8+) with the two parking-lot items that were explicitly gated on "planned work finished"
   (Cloudflare Access JWT validation, passwordless login).
2. **Sequencing.** The owner chose **fully parallel**: the code audit/changelog review and the Access
   JWT/passwordless work happen on separate branches at the same time, accepting the risk that the audit could
   flag something in the auth path and cause rework, rather than sequencing them.
3. **Stale owner checklist (from the phase 3 handoff).** GitHub private vulnerability reporting toggle, approving
   `audits/claude-md-proposed-edits.md`, and turning off Host-A debug logging (`KIPPLE_LOG_LEVEL`,
   `KIPPLE_LOG_GREADER_FORMS`) were never marked closed. The owner will flip debug logging off himself (ssh to
   Host-A, edit `.env`, restart `kipple`). The Host-A-side Proton Drive backup job for Kipple's own data (separate
   from Host-B's `Host-BProtonBackup`) is **not** being built in phase 5 - local `docker cp` snapshots stay the
   only backup path for now.
4. **Parking-lot scope boundary.** The owner's rule for phase 5: **only work directly related to Kipple and its
   Docker image.** In: auto-night theme (small, self-contained, ships in phase 5). Out: the 1.5.0/2.0.0
   setup-app/single-image roadmap, a design system, a static demo site, and user-chosen Google Fonts (all stay
   parked, unchanged from the existing parking-lot timing).
5. **Owner involvement.** The owner wants to be **involved as little as possible** in phase 5. Practical reading:
   batch work into branches/PRs and only interrupt him for the things CLAUDE.md already reserves for him -
   deploys, Cloudflare changes, and the final go/no-go - not for routine build decisions in between.

**Phase 5 outline (final):**
- (A) Full code audit + changelog review (Sonnet routine, Opus review/judging, per the existing model policy).
- (B) Cloudflare Access JWT validation + passwordless login, on a branch, in parallel with (A). Needs the owner's
  Cloudflare-side Access app config before the JWT work can be verified end-to-end.
- (C) Auto-night theme.
- (D) Documentation run, first-time Docker setup walkthrough, backup/restore-settings guide.
- (E) Final go/no-go meeting.

No deploys happen without asking first, per standing instruction; Cloudflare changes stay the owner's.
